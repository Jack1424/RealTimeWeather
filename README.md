### A lightweight Minecraft server plugin that allows you to sync your server's time and weather with the real world

## ⚠️ This is the legacy branch of RealTimeWeather ⚠️
**Only use legacy versions of RealTimeWeather (v1.x.x) if you NEED support for older versions of Minecraft.**
**If you don't need support for versions older than the most recent versions of Minecraft, don't use the legacy versions of this plugin.**
Legacy versions of RealTimeWeather will not receive as many (if any) updates.

**Current Features:**
- Lightweight
- Easy setup
- Supports all Minecraft versions from 1.7+

**Upcoming Features:**

## Installation
Just download the [latest version](https://github.com/Jack1424/RealTimeWeather/releases/) of **a legacy version** of RTW **(legacy versions are any version that starts with v1)** and put it in your `plugins` directory. 
You'll need to run your server at least once to generate the configuration file.
After running (and then stopping) your server, simply change the values in the configuration file to what you'd like, and you're good to go.

## Contributions/Support
**Legacy versions won't receive as many (if any) updates**, but I'm open to any help/ideas that you have. Just open an issue or a pull request, and I'll be sure to look at it as soon as I can. Builds with `gradlew shadowJar`.
